A chrome extension: Use shortcuts to control web based media players from any tab in any window in Chrome.  Pronounced: 'Shaw-Tee Play-Ya'.

To Install :
* In chrome go to chrome://settings/extensions#
* Check developer mode on the right.
* click "Load unpacked extension"
* locate folder on disk

Grooveshark and Google Music are the two currently supported players.
Right now the shortcuts are hardcoded to the ctrl plus a direction key.
Down - play pause 
Left - reverse
Right – forward

Multiple Player Action Precedence:
[if] If media is currently playing in a tab it will receive the action
[else if] Otherwise if no media is playing than the last tab to have received an action will again receive the action.
[else] If none op the first tab with a supported media player will receive the action



I tried to make it easy to add additional players.  There are three places you need to edit to add a player and they are marked in the comments by “ *player specific information* ”.  

It is also easy to edit the shortcuts in the code look for “CUSTOMIZE SHORTCUTS HERE :” in the comments.
